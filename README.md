# Benjamin Rix PhD, MSc, BSc (Hons)
A seasoned professional with a comprehensive background in data analysis, I bring a wealth of expertise cultivated through academic achievements, including a Ph.D., MSc, and BSc, and practical experience as a Healthcare Scientist in the NHS. Proficient in handling large datasets, my focus over the past year has been on expanding my technical capabilities, particularly in Python and SQL. This dedicated effort has equipped me with the skills needed to efficiently manipulate, analyze, and visualize data. Notably, my commitment to advancing the field is evidenced by my publication of a bioinformatic Python tool, reflecting both technical prowess and a contribution to innovative solutions in data science. Positioned at the intersection of academic rigor and practical application, I am poised to make valuable contributions as a Data Scientist/Analyst.
